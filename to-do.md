# To-Do

## Must
* Remove all test code.
* Test routing functionality with Vishnu.
* Change API keys to that of David's account.
* Figure a way to deploy(ask vishnu).

## Optional
* Show current Json stack.
* Change UI to a modal based interface (may not be possible as each button is a route to index)

## Done
* Add feature to convert input of "changeStatus" to Camel Case.
* Make a landing page that has guidelines to how the operator should use this shitty app.
* Figure ways to change the way recruiters are stored.
